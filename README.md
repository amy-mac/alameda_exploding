# Is Alameda Exploding?
This was a small project inspired by Is Oakland On Fire?. It provides a one-stop site for those who live on Alameda Island to quickly discover why we're hearing fireworks _this_ time.

## Holidays
The site checks for these holidays celebrated in our area because there might be fireworks
- New Year's Eve
- Lunar New Year's Day
- Independence Day

## Sports
Checks for these home team events
- San Francisco Giants at AT&T Park
- Oakland Athletics at Oakland Coliseum
- Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena

More loud events coming soon.
